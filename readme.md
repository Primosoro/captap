CapTap is a rhythm game that combines the simplicity of Muse Dash with the variety that Guitar Hero offers. 
The purpose of a rhythm game is for players to hit notes on beat to the song being played. 
Players will lose points for hitting each note a little off beat or missing the note completely. 
But if the note is hit perfectly players will be granted more points and bonuses. 
Rhythm games typically also include a combo mechanic with each note hit without a miss in between.
